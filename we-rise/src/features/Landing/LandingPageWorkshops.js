// Radical Wikipedia Editing Workshop
// Join <<>> for a workshop on how to update Wikipedia articles and write new ones.
// I will also share my experience on donating work to Wikipedia and how to contribute to it in a way that helps 
// make marginalized communities more visible. All skill levels are welcome.
// I'm working towards creating a space that encourages people of color and women to join the Wikipedia 
// movement and asks white men to focus on gaps in coverage on Wikipedia. 

// Radical DIY Collabortive Publishing
// This workshop covers the history and contemporary applications of radical independent and collaborative publishing models 
// including Cartoneras, zines, protest posters, prints, mud stencils, social sculptures, art builds, and more.

// Participants will learn effective devices of democratization by creating unique hand-painted, hinge and stab bound 
// structures using cardboard and up-cycled materials. Such structures enable social, political, and artistic expressions 
// and merge visual and literary forms. The hinge-bound structure can double as a multi tool (“swiss army knife”) of protest posters 
// — made for and by the people!

// Participants are responsible for sourcing their own supplies from the materials list. 
// Teaching artists will answer questions about materials in advance of the workshop start date.

// If It’s Broke, Learn How to Fix It: Radical Repair Workshop
// One of the easiest ways of connecting to new audiences has been to ask questions about objects to which people have a special 
// connection. Is it a favorite mug, sweatshirt or toy? What happened to it over time? How important is it to you to hold on to it 
// and in what condition? If you could make it new again, would you? Why or why not? Radical Repair Workshop recognizes and 
// celebrates the sentimentality of objects and their emotional significance in people’s lives. While she creates repairs for 
// herself that are often sculptural interventions, Gartrell teaches the skills that her students need to extend the lives of the 
// objects they care about or have 
// made an impact in their lives. Gartrell and Radical Repair Workshop value both the useful and absurd and are using Sonny and pop-up programs to inspire 
// participants to see, use and appreciate both sculptural and traditional modes of mending.
