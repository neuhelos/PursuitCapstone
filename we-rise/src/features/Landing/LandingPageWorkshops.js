// If It’s Broke, Learn How to Fix It: Radical Repair Workshop
// One of the easiest ways of connecting to new audiences has been to ask questions about objects to which people have a special 
// connection. Is it a favorite mug, sweatshirt or toy? What happened to it over time? How important is it to you to hold on to it 
// and in what condition? If you could make it new again, would you? Why or why not? Radical Repair Workshop recognizes and 
// celebrates the sentimentality of objects and their emotional significance in people’s lives. While she creates repairs for 
// herself that are often sculptural interventions, Gartrell teaches the skills that her students need to extend the lives of the 
// objects they care about or have 
// made an impact in their lives. Gartrell and Radical Repair Workshop value both the useful and absurd and are using Sonny and pop-up programs to inspire 
// participants to see, use and appreciate both sculptural and traditional modes of mending.
